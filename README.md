SwissKnife is a Deno module that allows you to do some useful tasks on Windows OS using NirCmd v2.86

## Usage

### Sound Library

```

```bash
deno -A myfile.ts #Requires allow-run and allow-write permissions
```

You can also set the rate and the volume:

```ts
import * as swissKnife from "./mod.ts"
let res = await swissKnife.speak("Hello from the other world", {rate: 3, volume: 80})
//rate: -10 -> 10
//volume: 0% -> 100%
```

### Computer System volume

```ts
import * as swissKnife from "./mod.ts"

//Set the volume
await swissKnife.setVolume(90) //value between 0 to 100

//mute the system sound
await swissKnife.mute()

//unmute the system sound
await swissKnife.unmute()
```

### Play beeps

await swissKnife.beep(freq, duration)

The freq (Frequance) parameter specifies the freq in hertz, the duration parameter specifies the duration of the sound in milliseconds.

await swissKnife.beep(500, 1000) //play 500 hz for 1 sec.
```
